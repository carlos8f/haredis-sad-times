# Get you some Redis cluster

Quick and dirty script to get 3 Redis instances up on different ports of localhost
in as little time as possible. Basically, you do this:

```
git clone git://github.com/sheldonh/gysrc.git
cd gysrc
./get-you-some-redis-cluster start
```

I wrote this to make it easy for my team to play with [haredis] (https://github.com/carlos8f/haredis).
